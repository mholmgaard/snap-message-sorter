# snap-message-sorter
At Snapchat you can request a copy of your data: https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/downloadmydata

Doing so gives you a `chat_history.json` file, which is split into:
* Received Saved Chat History
* Sent Saved Chat History

This script combines these and keeps them sorted based on the date, and a username you provide.
